## Network errors

If you encounter errors in our network‚Äîsuch as misplaced stops, incorrect line names, or other inaccuracies‚Äîwe greatly appreciate your feedback. Here‚Äôs the best way to report these issues:

- [**Formal complaint**](https://www.carrismetropolitana.pt/contacts) ‚Äî It might seem overkill, but we're optimized to handle this type of feedback. Submitting your feedback through the official complaint channels ensures that your report is directed to the appropriate team for review and resolution. This is the most reliable way to have your concerns addressed effectively.
- [**Github Issues**](https://github.com/carrismetropolitana/gtfs/issues) ‚Äî Opening an Issue in our gtfs repository is a great way to keep track of resolution status and requires less effort than a formal complaint. These types of issues are regularly monitored by the relevant teams.

While we take great care to ensure our network is error-free, we do have a _big_ network. We appreciate your patience while we resolve your reported issues, as even though they might seem simple to fix they usually are not. We thank you for your cooperation in keeping Carris Metropolitana network in good shape.


## Software errors

If you detect a bug in our software, we kindly ask for you to open an issue in the relevant Github repository. Clear reproduction steps are crucial to ensure quick resolution. If you can, opening a PR guarantees instant love from us.

We appreciate your feedback, both for reporting bugs as well as feature requests.
