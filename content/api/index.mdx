## No special treatment

All routes documented here are the same ones we use in our website, mobile apps, and internal tools.
We don’t apply any “special treatment” to our APIs—everyone has access to the same information at the same time,
ensuring fairness and transparency in how the data is shared and utilized.


## Versions

The API is versioned to ensure stability and backward compatibility. If we need to make breaking changes to how endpoints
behave in order to support new features, we will always increment the API version to avoid disrupting existing usage.

Since this is a JSON API, adding new properties to endpoints is not considered a breaking change, as these properties
can be safely ignored by API consumers. Therefore, in such cases, the API version may not be bumped.
This approach allows us to introduce enhancements while minimizing the impact on existing integrations.


## Uniform Response Structure

All API responses are designed to follow the JSend specification. This standardized structure ensures consistency across endpoints
and provides a framework for including additional debugging information when needed.

In the case of errors, the JSend format offers a clear and structured way to describe what went wrong and, where possible,
how the issue might be resolved. This approach simplifies error handling for API consumers and improves the overall developer experience.

```json title="Success Response"
{
	status: "success",
	timestamp: 1721023200,
	data: [] or {} // The requested data
}
```

```json title="Error Response"
{
	status: "error",
	timestamp: 1721023200,
	message: "Unable to communicate with database"
}
```


## Typescript

To make working with our API responses easier, we provide an [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@carrismetropolitana/api-types)
that includes TypeScript definitions for all API responses. This package helps ensure type safety and improves development efficiency
when integrating with our API in JavaScript or TypeScript projects.

We plan to expand this package with additional functionality in the future, and we welcome contributions! If you’d like to help,
feel free to submit a pull request to the repository.


## Collections

The API is organized into collections, such as `network` and `metrics`, each grouping related endpoints.
All JSON endpoints across collections adhere to the same standardized structure, ensuring consistency and simplicity.
Below are the available collections:

<Cards>
    <Card title="network" href="/api/network">
        Endpoints related to the transit network, including stops, lines, routes, patterns, shapes, vehicles, GTFS data, and more.
    </Card>
    <Card title="facilities" href="/api/facilities">
        Covers facilities within the Lisbon Metropolitan Area served by Carris Metropolitana, such as schools, hospitals, and other key locations.
		Each facility type has a dedicated endpoint.
    </Card>
    <Card title="locations" href="/api/locations">
        Provides data on administrative divisions within amL, including districts, municipalities, parishes, and localities.
		These are used to identify the locations of network points and facilities.
    </Card>
    <Card title="metrics" href="/api/metrics">
        Offers real-time metrics from Carris Metropolitana’s operations, providing insights into system performance and activity.
    </Card>
</Cards>
