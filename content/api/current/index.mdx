## What's new

This API version brings several enhancements to improve stability, data quality, and overall performance. Key updates include:

- **Improved Data Fetchers and Parsers**
  Enhancements ensure faster data processing with zero delay between vehicle updates and API responses. The system is now more resilient to restarts and failures, ensuring reliable operation.

- **Future Schedule and Path Changes**
  A major new feature in this version is support for future schedule and path changes. Patterns can now have multiple versions to accommodate changes in path, shape, or metadata.
  This introduces a breaking change from previous endpoints. [Learn more about patterns ›](/api/current/network/patterns)

- **Enhanced Vehicles Endpoint**
  The vehicles endpoint has been revamped to include static vehicle metadata, such as model, make, owner, seat count, etc. and new real-time data, including occupancy levels (when available).

These updates ensure a more robust and feature-rich API for all users.
