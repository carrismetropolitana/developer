## Data source

Currently, locations are fetched directly from the GTFS data and are not georeferenced. Enhancements to include georeferenced locations are planned for future updates.


## Available locations

The API provides the following locations in JSON format:


### Regions

Regions are the top-level geographic division in the API. Currently, there are three regions available: **amL (Lisbon Metropolitan Area)**, **Alentejo Central** and **Oeste**.
Regions are identified using their NUTS-III code, ensuring consistency with official geographic standards.

  hasHead={false}
/>

<AutoTypeTable path="./node_modules/@carrismetropolitana/api-types/src/api/locations.ts" name="Region" />


### Districts

Districts are subdivisions within a region and are identified by their ***DI***COFRE code, a standardized identifier for geographic areas. Each district is associated with its parent region.

```

<AutoTypeTable path="./node_modules/@carrismetropolitana/api-types/src/api/locations.ts" name="District" />


### Municipalities

Municipalities are subdivisions within a district and are identified by their ***DICO***FRE code. Every geographical data point in the API is associated with at least one municipality, making it the “primary key” for location types.

```
https://api.carrismetropolitana.pt/v2/locations/municipalities
```

<AutoTypeTable path="./node_modules/@carrismetropolitana/api-types/src/api/locations.ts" name="Municipality" />


### Parishes

Parishes, known as “freguesias,” are optional administrative divisions within municipalities. They are identified by their ***DICOFRE*** code. Currently, only a limited number of objects in the API are associated with this location type.
Expanding the use of parishes to enhance geographic precision is planned for future updates.

### Localities

Localities are informal places known to local populations. We use this to diferentiate the location of similarly named objects. Objects may not have localities.
