## Data source

Currently, locations are fetched directly from the GTFS data and are not georeferenced. Enhancements to include georeferenced locations are planned for future updates.


## Available locations

The API provides the following locations in JSON format:


### Districts

Districts are the top level division in the API and are identified by their ***DI***COFRE code, a standardized identifier for geographic areas.

<APIPage
  document="https://api.cmet.pt/openapi"
  operations={[{ path: '/locations/districts', method: 'get' }]}
  hasHead={false}
/>


### Municipalities

Municipalities are subdivisions within a district and are identified by their ***DICO***FRE code. Every geographical data point in the API is associated with at least one municipality, making it the “primary key” for location types.

<APIPage
  document="https://api.cmet.pt/openapi"
  operations={[{ path: '/locations/municipalities', method: 'get' }]}
  hasHead={false}
/>


### Parishes

Parishes, known as “freguesias,” are optional administrative divisions within municipalities. They are identified by their ***DICOFRE*** code. Currently, only a limited number of objects in the API are associated with this location type.
Expanding the use of parishes to enhance geographic precision is planned for future updates.

### Localities

Localities are informal places known to local populations. We use this to diferentiate the location of similarly named objects. Objects may not have localities.
