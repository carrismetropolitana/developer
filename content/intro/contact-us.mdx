## Open communication

Our prefered style of communication is in the open. If you'd like to say hi! or alert us about a new community project, opening a Github issue in any repo is the way to go.

However, if you prefer a more direct approach, you can find contact details on each team memberâ€™s public GitHub profile. Reach out from your prefered platform! ðŸ™‚


## Complaints

Submitting your feedback through the [official complaint channels](https://www.carrismetropolitana.pt/contacts) ensures that your report is directed to the appropriate team for review and resolution. This is the most reliable way to have your concerns addressed effectively.
