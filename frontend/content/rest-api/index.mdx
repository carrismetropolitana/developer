### Commitment to Open data

Carris Metropolitana is deeply commited to open data. Most, if not all, of the code produced internally is published on Github. We welcome comments and PRs.
Carris Metropolitana also regularly shares metrics about its operation. This includes big numbers (eg. transported passengers) and detailed data about the quality of service for each line.
Many of these numbers are provided in the API so that they can be consumed in realtime. All our public facing apps (website, native) consume the same endpoints provided to the public,
as this ensures everyone has access to the same up-to-date information while also simplifying our tech stack.


### What this API is and what it is not

**Carris Metropolitana** and **Carris (municipal)** are two separate entities. Carris (municipal) operates exclusively within Lisbon city boundaries, while Carris Metropolitana operates in 15 of the 18 municipalities of the Lisbon metropolitan area.
This API provides scheduled and realtime data for Carris Metropolitana. If you are looking for a particular bus operator's data please take a look at the following table. For other transit modes [click here](#).

### Versions

The API is versioned. We might need to perform breaking changes to the way endpoints behave in order to support new features; we will always bump the API version to avoid dirupting existing uses.
Since this is JSON API, for any new property added to any endpoint, we might or might not bump the API version. This is because we do not consider these as breaking changes,
as these new properties can be safely ignored by API consumers.


### Collections

This API is organized into collections (eg. `network` or `metrics`). All JSON endpoints of all collections follow the same basic structure. Available collections are:

| Collection                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [network](/rest-api/network)    | All network-related endpoints. These include stops, lines, routes, patterns, shapes, vehicles, GTFS, etc.                                                                    |
| [facilities](/rest-api/network) | Facilities are places in amL that Carris Metropolitana serves. These include schools, hospitals, etc. Each facility type has its own endpoint.                               |
| [locations](/rest-api/network)  | Locations are administrative divisions of amL. Districts, Municipalities, Parishes and Localities. These are used to identify the location of network points and facilities. |
| [metrics](/rest-api/network)    | Realtime metrics from the Carris Metropolitana operation.                                                                                                                    |
